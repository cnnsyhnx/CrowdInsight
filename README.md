# CrowdInsight

CrowdInsight is a Python-based computer vision and AI library designed to analyze foot traffic and visitor demographics using CCTV footage or live streams. It detects and classifies entities such as adults, children, men, women, and animals (e.g., dogs), and generates actionable insights for businesses and institutions.

## üöÄ Features

- üìπ CCTV Video File & Live Stream Input  
- üß† Object Detection & Classification (adult, child, male, female, dog)  
- üîÅ Visitor Tracking with DeepSORT or ByteTrack  
- üìä Analytics Engine for temporal and demographic patterns  
- üì§ Export to CSV/JSON for external dashboards  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular and extendable

## üìÅ Example Usage

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Analyze a Video File

```python
from crowdinsight import CrowdAnalyzer

analyzer = CrowdAnalyzer(video_path="videos/cctv.mp4")
results = analyzer.run_analysis()

print(results.summary())
results.export_csv("output.csv")
```

### üì° Analyze Live Webcam or IP Camera

```python
from crowdinsight import CrowdAnalyzer

analyzer = CrowdAnalyzer(video_source=0)  # Use 0 for default webcam or 'rtsp://...' for IP cam
analyzer.run_live_stream()
```
